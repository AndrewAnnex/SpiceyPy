Introduction
------------

SpiceyPy is a python wrapper for the `SPICE Toolkit <http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/>`__.
SPICE is an essential tool for scientists and engineers alike in the planetary
science field for Solar System Geometry. Please visit the NAIF website for more details about SPICE.

*IMPORTANT*: I have no current affiliation with NASA, NAIF, or JPL. The
code is provided "as is", use at your own risk.

Installation
------------

First install the dependencies (numpy, six, pytest) for the project. Then
run ``pip install spiceypy`` to install from pypi.

SpiceyPy is also available through conda by either first installing pip via conda or by running
``conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/andrewannex spiceypy``.

If you wish to install spiceypy from source first download or clone the project. Then run ``python setup.py install``.
To uninstall run ``pip uninstall spiceypy``.

Documentation
-------------

The SpiceyPy docs are available at:
`spiceypy.readthedocs.org <http://spiceypy.readthedocs.org>`__.
The documentation for SpiceyPy is intentionally abridged so as to utilize the excellent `documentation provided by the
NAIF. <http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/index.html>`__
Please refer to C and IDL documentation available on the NAIF website
for in-depth explanations. Each function docstring has a link to the
corresponding C function in the NAIF docs at a minimum.

How to Help
-----------

Feedback is always welcomed, if you discover that a function is not working as expected,
submit an issue detailing how to reproduce the problem. If you utilize SpiceyPy frequently 
please consider contributing to the project by citing me using the zenodo DOI above.

Citing SpiceyPy
---------------

If the use of SpiceyPy is used in a publication, please consider
citing SpiceyPy and the SPICE toolkit. The citation information
for SPICE can be found on the NAIF website. To cite SpiceyPy please
utilize the zenodo DOI badge at the top of this readme.

Known Working Environments:
---------------------------

SpicyPy is now compatible with modern Linux, Mac, and Windows
environments. Since the package is a wrapper, any environment not
supported by the NAIF is similarly not supported by SpiceyPy.
If you run into issues with your system please submit an issue with details. 
Please note that support for Python minor versions are generally phased out 
as newer versions are released. 

- OS: OS X, Linux, Windows
- CPU: 64bit & 32bit
- Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
